# Product Requirements Document: Windows Process Monitor

## 1. Overview

The Windows Process Monitor is a lightweight, open-source tool designed to provide real-time visibility into the processes and resource usage of a Windows system. It offers an intuitive interface to explore active processes, their CPU and memory consumption, and system-wide resource allocation. This tool is ideal for users interested in understanding how Windows manages applications and resources, providing a simplified window into operating system internals.

## 2. Goals

- **Process Exploration**: Enable users to view all active processes, their identifiers, and resource usage.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Provide real-time tracking of CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
- **Logging Capabilities**: Allow users to record process activity over time for analysis.
- **Process Control**: Offer functionality to terminate misbehaving processes.
- **Educational Insight**: Help users understand Windows process management, scheduling, and memory allocation.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Replacing the full functionality of Windows Task Manager.
- Complete system monitoring (e.g., GPU usage, performance profiling).
- Supporting platforms outside of Windows for core functionality.

## 4. Target Audience

- Users curious about the inner workings of Windows and interested in exploring processes and system behavior.
- Students, developers, or enthusiasts seeking a hands-on learning tool for operating system concepts.

## 5. Use Cases

1. **Explore Processes**: View all active processes, their identifiers, parent/child relationships, CPU, and memory usage.
2. **Monitor Resources**: Track real-time CPU, memory, disk, and network usage for selected processes or the system as a whole.
3. **Log Activity**: Record process activity over time to observe patterns, spikes, or unexpected behavior.
4. **Process Control**: Optionally terminate misbehaving processes in a controlled manner.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### Core Features

- Display a list of all active processes with:
  - Process ID (PID)
  - Process name and status
  - CPU and memory usage
- Show parent/child process relationships.
- Provide system-wide resource summaries (CPU, memory, disk, network).

### Extended Features

- Continuous logging to CSV or JSON at configurable intervals.
- Filter by process name, PID, or resource usage.
- Display top-N processes by CPU or memory usage.
- Terminate selected processes.

### Optional Features

- Live updating interactive CLI table or simple GUI for visual monitoring.
- Graphical representation of resource usage trends over time.

## 7. Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: Windows 10/11
- **Languages/Frameworks**: Python 3.11+ or C#/.NET
- **Dependencies**:
  - `psutil` for process and resource information
  - `tabulate` or `rich` for formatted console output
- **Design Considerations**:
  - Class-based, modular architecture for future extensibility
  - CLI interface with optional GUI for enhanced interactivity

## 8. Deliverables

- Functional process monitor with logging and filtering.
- Example datasets demonstrating process monitoring outputs.
- Documentation describing usage, installation, and insights into Windows process and memory management.

## 9. Milestones

### Week 1 – Core Process Listing

- Implement CLI to list all processes with PID, name, status, CPU, and memory.
- Display parent-child relationships.

### Week 2 – Resource Monitoring & Logging

- Add disk and network I/O tracking per process.
- Implement configurable logging to CSV/JSON.
- Add filtering capabilities for selected processes.

### Week 3 – Interactivity & Polish

- Add the ability to terminate processes.
- Enhance CLI or provide a simple GUI with live updates.
- Complete documentation detailing the system design and Windows behavior insights.

## 10. Success Criteria

- The monitor provides accurate and real-time visibility into running processes and system resources.
- Users can observe and reason about Windows process behavior, memory usage, and scheduling.
- The tool is intuitive, lightweight, and reliable, providing a smooth learning experience for curious users.
